21,Video,mikeescamilla,116k,"1,708","Happy Birthday Pablo. You would of been 40 today.

It’s been 238 days since I lost my youngest brother on New Years Eve. There hasn’t been a day that goes by that I don’t think about him and not a week that goes by that I don’t find myself in tears driving alone in the car or up late at night trying to fall asleep. I haven’t spoke at all about this publicly cause there were no words to describe the feeling in my gut and heart. Not sure there is yet either but as today grew closer I just felt the need to celebrate you... I miss you, we were not super close but that didn’t stop you from trying...and calling me at inappropriate times just to say I love you and to tell me about your day. You lived 650 miles away for the over half our lives. To hear how your close friends and the town spoke about you it’s clear I truly missed out on that wonderful heart of yours.. I have a tidal wave of emotion writing this and so much to say to you and about who you are. But I’m still not quite there.... I love you Pablo... Happy Birthday... we miss you... ❤️",,https://www.instagram.com/p/CEUukIYn1EK/
