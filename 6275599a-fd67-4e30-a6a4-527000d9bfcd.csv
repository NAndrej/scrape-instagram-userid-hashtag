All the other followed by fusing hydrogen into helium, which then fused into carbon and so on. Approximately 73% of the mass of the visible universe is in the form of hydrogen. Helium makes up about 25% of the mass, and everything else represents only 2%. By mass, hydrogen and helium combined make up less than 1% of the Earth.","4,196",https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Nvxcnh4-e/
